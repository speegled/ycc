This repo contains csv formatted files with the results of the YCC ultimate tournament. So far, only the 2016-2017 U20 boys games have been formatted. Ideally, I would like to have all of the games from all years of the tournament available.  Before doing so, I would like to reformat everything into a standard format; so that team names from year-to-year are constant. This would allow much easier data analysis across years. If anyone wants to help with any of this, I would appreciate it. I don't anticipate having time to do much with this for the next few months.

It also contains an analysis of the differences that the tournament format from 2016 to 2017 made.
